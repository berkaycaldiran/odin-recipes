    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It's much more easier than you think to make a deep fried turkey, as long as you have something to fry the turkey (even camp fire works!).</p>
    <p>In the following section I'll give you the ingredients that you'll need along our cooking journey.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 1/2 Peanut Oil: Peanut oil is fine, as it has a high smoke point and neutral flavor.</li>
        <li>1 (10 pound) whole Turkey, neck and giblets removed: Of course we need a turkey! Without it what we would do, huh?</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt and ground pepper: This deep-fried turkey recipe is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Be sure of we have what we need to cook our turkey. Shall we go to directions section?</p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large stockpot or turkey fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Make sure the fryer is located outdoors in a safe area, preferably on dirt or pavement, and far away from buildings, wooden decks, or other objects. Keep a fire extinguisher handy, just in case.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the turkey is completely thawed. Cut any extra skin away from the neck area and make sure neck hole is at least 1 inch in diameter. Pat the bird completely dry with paper towels, then rub liberally with salt and pepper on both the outside and the inside. Place turkey into a drain basket, neck-side first.</li>
        <li>Working slowly and carefully, gently lower the basket into the hot oil to completely cover the turkey. Maintain the temperature of the oil at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and cook turkey for 3 1/2 minutes per pound, about 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove basket from oil, and drain turkey. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh; the internal temperature must be 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Allow to rest for 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
